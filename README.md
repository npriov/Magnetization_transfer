Recently, I have been setting up some in vivo Magnetization Transfer experiments. Magnetization transfer refers to the saturation of the free-water pool from bound protons that do not otherwise contribute to the signal due to their short T2. A simplified model of this exchange assumes two pools, similar to the multiexponential T2/T2* experiments (see the seminal paper of Henkelman 1991 on this). The lineshape of the spectrum is presumed to be either Gaussian for phantoms or (super) Lorenzian for brain tissue. The functions here implement a fitting for this model, with either of the two lineshapes. The saturation train is approximated with a single pulse (Ramani 2002). Your output will look like this.
